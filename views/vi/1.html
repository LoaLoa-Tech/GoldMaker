For example, if <code>fs.writeFile()</code> is called twice in a row, first to write the
string <code>'Hello'</code>, then to write the string <code>', World'</code>, the file would contain
<code>'Hello, World'</code>, and might contain some of the file's original data (depending
on the size of the original file, and the position of the file descriptor). If
a file name had been used instead of a descriptor, the file would be guaranteed
to contain only <code>', World'</code>.
